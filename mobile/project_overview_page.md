# Project Overview page
{: #project_overview}

You can view and work with a single {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Mobile dashboard project by selecting the project on the Projects page, which opens the Project Overview page. 
{: shortdesc}

The Project Overview page displays a tile for each service that is configured or available for configuring with the selected project. The tile displays the type of the service and an *actions* button with three vertically-aligned dots. Examples of services that might be available or configured include {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} or Analytics. The compatible services are dependent on the type of project and the services that are available in that region, so not all services will be available to associate with all projects. 

When a type of service is not yet associated with the project, a **Create** button is displayed on the tile. The actions button options are to create an instance of the service or to add an existing service when the service is not already associated. Selecting **Add Existing** provides a list of the service instances of that type that are not associated with other projects. Services can only be associated with one project at a time.

If the service is already associated with this project, the name of the associated service instance is displayed on the tile after the type of service. This makes it easy to find which service instance is related to this project on your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard. The actions that are available on the actions button are **View** and **Remove** when the service is already associated with the project. Removing a service instance only removes the association to this project and does not delete the instance of the service from your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.

Select **Get Code** on the Build tile to download the code for your project. For more information about downloading the code, see [Get code](get_code.html).
