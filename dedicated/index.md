## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated architecture
{: #dedicatedarch}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated is built on SoftLayer so that you have the highest performing cloud infrastructure available to you. Each data center has 24 hour, 7 days a week security, and rigorous controls. You and IBM access your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dedicated instance through a VPN tunnel and a private VLAN.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated sits on your network through a VPN or a direct network connection. Your single-tenant hardware can be set up in any SoftLayer data center around the world. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} manages the dedicated platform and dedicated services, so you can focus on building custom apps. In addition, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} performs all maintenance to dedicated instances during a maintenance window selected by you.

![{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated](images/dedicated.png "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated")

*Figure 1. Detailed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated diagram*

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated environments have the same security standards as the public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in terms of infrastructure, operational, and physical security. However, developer access to the dedicated {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is controlled by your LDAP policies, which can be configured by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} team when they set up your environment. Within the dedicated environment, you can manage user roles and permissions. See [Managing users and permissions](../admin/index.html#oc_useradmin) for details.

##Maintaining your dedicated instance
{: #maintaindedicated}

IBM maintains and installs updates and fixes as IBM deems appropriate to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} runtimes and services. Services might not be available during maintenance windows. In addition, IBM works with you to schedule maintenance updates for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform.

The following types of maintenance are required for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated:
<dl>
<dt>**Standard maintenance for services**</dt>
<dd>The services utilize pre-defined, standard maintenance windows, which might cause the services to be unavailable. IBM does not require customer approval to perform service maintenance, but attempts to minimize impact to your services.<br />
<br />
IBM sends broadcast messages of the changes that are planned for each maintenance window on the Status page.<br />
<br />
**Important**: Some service might not be available to you during the maintenance period.</dd>

<dt>**Standard maintenance for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform**</dt>
<dd>Maintenance updates are applied based on coordination between you and IBM within a 21-day window. You provide IBM with preapproved maintenance windows and specific dates or times that might not work for you, and IBM works to schedule updates during or around the dates that you selected.
<p>
<p>Go to **ADMINISTRATION > SYSTEM INFORMATION** to view scheduled and pending maintenance updates. For more information about setting your preapproved windows, unavailable dates, and viewing or approving maintenance updates, see <a href="../admin/index.html#oc_schedulemaintenance">Maintenance updates</a></p>.</dd>
</dl>

**Important**: IBM reserves the right to interrupt services to apply emergency maintenance as needed. IBM might change scheduled maintenance hours, but will notify you of any such changes, as well as any emergency maintenance information.

If there is a reported issue following a maintenance update, you agree with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support if it is in your best interest to allow IBM to roll back the update. Upon agreement, IBM rolls back the update to restore the environment to the previous state.

## Disaster recovery
{: #dr}

Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Dedicated can be set up similarly to the way that it works when you use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Public. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Public provides a continuously available platform for innovation with multiple fail-safe measures to ensure that your orgs, spaces, and apps are always available. Deploying apps to multiple geographic regions enables continuous availability that protects against unplanned, simultaneous loss of multiple hardware or software components, or the loss of an entire data center, so that even in the event of a natural disaster in one geographic location, your distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public app instances in alternate geographic locations will be available.
{: shortdesc}

Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Dedicated is made possible through continuous availability for your apps, the inherent high availability of the platform, and the ability to restore your instance in the event of a failure. You are responsible for enabling continuous availability of your apps by deploying to multiple regions. High availability is built in at the platform level through  technologies included in Cloud Foundry and other components. And, you can work together with IBM to ensure your data is properly backed up in the case that you need to restore your instance at any time.

### Enabling continuous availability for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated
{: #enabling}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public deploys to multiple geographic locations. However, you must do the following to enable globally distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated instances:

* Ensure that your developers are deploying apps in more than one region, either through a manual or automated process. Regions should be more than 200 km apart from each other to ensure that a natural disaster cannot affect both geographic locations.
* Configure a global load balancer, like Akamai or Dyn, to point to apps in at least two different regions.

**Note**: Not all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services support regional distribution. When you construct an application, if you want to achieve geographic distribution, then you must also make sure that the services that are used by that application have data synchronization as a key feature.

#### Deploying {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated apps to multiple geographic locations
{: #deploying}

To deploy into a second location or multiple locations, you must follow a process similar to the one you took to enable your primary geographic location:

1. Enable a new dedicated environment to host additional instances of your applications. To create a new environment, contact your IBM sales team to initiate the process. For more information about setting up a dedicated instance, see [Setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated](../dedicated/index.html#setupdedicated). You must log in separately to access each environment. Each physical location for the hosted environments should be a minimum of 200 km away from the original location to ensure availability.
2. Obtain the unique domain name where your new deployed app will be hosted. For example, if your original domain is *mycompany.east.bluemix.net*, then you can create a new dedicated environment with a new domain such as *mycompany.west.bluemix.net*, and deploy to the new domain.
3. Each time you deploy your original app, also deploy to the new location. For more information about deploying, see [Uploading your app](../starters/upload_app.html).


#### Enabling a global load balancer for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated
{: #glb}

A global load balancer not only ensures continuous availability and is required for disaster recovery, but it also has several additional benefits:

* Routes users to the closest {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region by default
* Routes based on performance
* Selectively directs a percentage of traffic to a new application version
* Provides site failover based on region health check
* Provides site failover based on application health check
* Uses weighted routing between endpoints

You can choose a global load balancer such as Akamai or Dyn. For more about using Akamai as a global load balancer, see [Global traffic management](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/products/web-performance/global-traffic-management.jsp){: new_window}. For more about using Dyn as a global load balancer, see [4 Reasons Businesses Are Taking Global Load Balancing to the Cloud](http://dyn.com/blog/4-reasons-businesses-are-taking-global-load-balancing-to-the-cloud/){: new_window}.

### High availability
{: #ha}

In addition to enabling continuous availability, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also provides high availability across the platform by using technologies built into Cloud Foundry and other components.

These technologies include the following:

<dl>
<dt>DEA Scalability in Cloud Foundry</dt>
<dd>A Cloud Foundry <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html" target="_blank">Droplet Execution Agent (DEA)</a> performs health checks on the apps running within it. If there is a problem with the app or the DEA itself, it deploys additional instances of the app to an alternate DEA to address the issue. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/high-availability.html" target="_blank">Configuring CF for High Availability with Redundancy</a>.<br />
<p>To ensure high availability for your applications, you need enough compute resources to balance the load, and you might also require additional compute resources to support a possible failure. If you need to scale your environment by increasing your DEA pool to be prepared for a failure or address a spike in the load for your app instances, you can work with your IBM representative to order additional DEAs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>SoftLayer redundancy</dt>
<dd>With SoftLayer in dedicated environments, data in each cloud storage cluster is written multiple times, and storage clusters are configured with auto-healing capabilities in case of drive failure. If there is a problem with a virtual server, SoftLayer tries to restart the virtual server on another host.</dd>
<dt>Metadata backup</dt>
<dd>Metadata is backed up using SoftLayer EVault Backup to a location that is a minimum of 200 km away.</dd>
</dl>

##Restoring your dedicated instance
{: #restorededicated}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated settings, metadata, and configurations are backed up regularly to prepare for any unplanned outages in the environment. Your data that you are responsible for backing up includes application data, cloud database services data, and object stores.

As part of the data backup, which includes system metadata and configurations, IBM completes the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Encrypts all backup copies and manages encryption keys</li>
<li>Monitors and manages backup activity</li>
<li>Provides the encrypted backup files</li>
<li>Restores the requested data</li>
<li>Manages scheduling conflicts between backup and fix management operations</li>
</ul>

Because protection of private data is critical, IBM needs your collaboration when dealing with backup file management, so that the files are not moved outside of your data centers. Specifically, IBM asks that you complete the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Move a copy of your encrypted backup data off-site, just as you would for any other backup data that you manage.</li>
<li>Provide the backup files for the IBM operator in case of any need to restore.</li>
</ul>
