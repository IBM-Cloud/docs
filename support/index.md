# Getting customer support
{: #getting-customer-support}



If you experience problems with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you have several support options, such as getting help through a forum, or opening a support ticket.
{:shortdesc}


## Getting help
{: #getting-help}
To open a support ticket or find other help options, you can use the Support widget. You can also go directly to the Stack Overflow or developerWorks (dW) Answers forums to search information or post questions. If you are using an account that is linked between {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}}, see [Using the Support widget for linked accounts](#using-avatar-linked) and [Opening a support ticket for linked accounts](#open-ticket-linked).

You can choose to receive these email notifications by clicking **Manage > Account > Notifications**  and selecting the **Platform** tab. For more information about setting account notifications, go to [Setting notifications](/docs/admin/account.html#notifications).


### Best practices for monitoring status
{: #best-practices}

  * Check for upcoming maintenance windows

	Check for upcoming maintenance windows posted on the status page, at least once every 24 hours, by using one of the following options:
	  * By navigating directly to the [Status ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://ibm.biz/bluemixstatus){: new_window} page
	  * By using the RSS feed or an RSS-to-email forwarder

  * Check for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress

	If you suspect that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is not functioning as expected, check the status page for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress. To report an incident that is not already listed on the status page, open a Support ticket by clicking **Support** and selecting **Add Ticket** on the menu bar or by accessing the [IBM Bluemix Support ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.biz/bluemixsupport){: new_window} help page.

  * Take advantage of multiple {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions

All users of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public automatically have access to the US-SOUTH, EU-GB, EU-DE, and AU-SYD regions. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Global Operations team manages all regions to avoid maintenance impacts and minimize the risk of incidents that affect all regions at the same time.

To switch regions, from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} menu bar, expand the **Region** menu, and then select the region you require information for.

  * Prepare for minor interruptions

    In most cases, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} can continue to be used normally, even during the maintenance window. However, minor interruptions of a service can't always be avoided. Running applications typically remain available even if the application management functions of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, such as starting and stopping apps, are temporarily interrupted. To maximize the availability of your running applications, run at least three instances of each application.

### How different services are supported
You define the severity of the issue based upon your business needs and your level of support. All tickets are investigated with the purpose of identifying and resolving the root cause. When problem diagnostic data is needed to determine the root cause of the issue, you will be asked for approval to access log files and other problem determination data from your application. Without this data, the resolution of your issue might be delayed. After the root cause analysis is completed, the team with take one of the following actions based on the root cause:
* IBM generally available service or container image<br>
If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM generally available service or container image, the ticket is addressed based upon the severity that you assign.
* IBM Beta service or container image<br>
IBM will release services or container images that are classified as a Beta release. A Beta release helps IBM development and marketing teams assess the value of the service in the market. As a result, they can make adjustments before potentially releasing it as a generally available service or container image. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM Beta service or container image, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. Additionally, the ticket is assigned a severity 3 or 4 as appropriate. 
* IBM experimental service or container image<br>
IBM will release services or container images that are classified as experimental. These services might be unstable, change frequently, and might be discontinued with a short notice. For services that are classified as experimental, you can obtain community assistance through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix){: new_window} and [dW Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/12/bluemix.html){: new_window} only.
* Third-party service<br>
Third-party services are provided by vendors outside of IBM. These services are provided by individual software entities, partners, or independent software vendors (ISV). If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party service, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. However, IBM will work through our Marketplace with the third-party service and our client to help solve the issue. 
* Open source or community service<br>
Open source or community services are provided by open source communities outside of IBM. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in an open source or community service, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. IBM will close the ticket and refer you to the community or forum for assistance. 


### Reporting a potential security vulnerability
{: #report-security-vulnerability}

If you believe a potential security vulnerability occurs, report it to Bluemix by opening a support ticket.
