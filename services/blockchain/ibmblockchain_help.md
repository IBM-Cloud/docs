# Getting help for blockchain
{: #ibmblockchain_help}


Wait for the new Atlas style UI and then we can implement this section.  Not enough content yet...

>This section will contain the various topics necessary to guide a BMX user through the help tab on the monitor dashboard.
Need input from dev team as they update the development staging area.  Dale Avery, Dave Huffman, Mihir Shah, Ben Smith, Gari Singh.  
What topics do we need here?  What screenshots do we need here?  What is our mechanism for online support?

>## Using the Service Status tab
{: #servicestatus}

>This topic will guide the users through how to digest the information displayed in their service status.  

>## Using the Kibana Live Logs
{: #kibana}

>Getting started with Kibana Logs.  
>Troubleshooting, configuring, accessing, filtering, and reading your live logs.
>Need to determine if we want all of this information self-contained within in this topic.  Or do we want to create an entirely new section >or do we want these sub-topics to exist as children of the "Using Kibana Live Logs" topic.  Also, where will the videos exist?  Do we want >to link externally or embed them in the BMX documentation?  TBD
