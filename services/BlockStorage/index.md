**New Endurance and Performance storage solutions available in IBM Bluemix**

You can now deploy block storage globally through the new **Infrastructure** category in IBM Bluemix®. For more information about using the Endurance and Performance storage solutions in the **Infrastructure** category, see [Block Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/block-storage). For additional documentation, see [Endurance Storage](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/endurance-storage) or [Performance Storage](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/performance-storage).

## Save data from your existing block storage volumes before 28 November 2016

Ensure that you save any data from your existing block storage volumes before 28 November 2016, when all virtual server instances will be suspended. If you need to resume an instance for some reason, you can contact IBM Bluemix support. All block storage volumes will be deleted on 24 December 2016.

Take action to retain data from your existing volumes. For example, use the **tar** command to create an archive file and copy it to another storage device.
