# Customizing the login widget

When the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}} service is configured with two or more identity providers, the user can select an identity provider in the login widget.

You can customize your login widget by completing the following steps:

1. Open the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} service dashboard.
2. Select the **Login Customization** section, where you can modify the appearance of the login widget to align with your company's brand.
3. Upload your company's logo by selecting a PNG or JPG file from your local system. The recommended image size is 320 x 320 pixels. The maximum file size is 100 Kb.
4. Select a header color for the widget from the color picker, or enter the hex code for another color.
5. Inspect the preview pane on the right of the screen, and click **Save Changes** when you are happy with your customizations. A confirmation message is displayed.

You are not required to rebuild your application. The image is stored in the App ID database and is displayed at the next login.
