# Enabling Facebook authentication for iOS apps (Swift SDK)
{: #facebook-auth-ios}

Last updated: 23 August 2016
{: .last-updated}


To use Facebook as an identity provider in your {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} iOS applications, add and configure the iOS Platform for your Facebook application.
{:shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #facebook-auth-ios-before}
 You must have
* An iOS project that is seft up to work with CocoaPods.  For more information, see **Install CocoaPods** in  [Setting up the iOS Swift SDK](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/getting-started-ios-swift-sdk.html).  
   **Note:** You do not need to install the core {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}  client SDK before proceeding.
* An instance of a  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application that is protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service. For more information about how to create a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} back-end application, see [Getting started](index.html).
* A Facebook application on the Facebook for Developers site. 


**Important:** You do not need to separately install the Facebook SDK (`com.facebook.FacebookSdk`). The Facebook SDK  installs automatically with the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} `BMSFacebookAuthentication` pod. You can skip the **Add the Facebook SDK to your Xcode Project** step when you add or configure your app on the Facebook for Developers website.

**Note:** While the Objective-C SDK remains fully supported, and is still considered the primary SDK for  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Mobile Services, there are plans to discontinue the Objective-C SDK later this year in favor of this new Swift SDK.
## Configuring your Facebook Application for the iOS Platform
{: #facebook-auth-ios-config}
On the Facebook for Developers site:

1. Log in to your account.
1. Ensure that the iOS platform has been added to your app. When you add or configure the iOS platform more details are provided about the following steps.

1. Specify the *bundleId* of your iOS application. To find the *bundleId* of your iOS application, look for the **Bundle Identifier** in either the `info.plist` file or Xcode project **General** tab.

  **Tip**: Consider enabling URL Scheme Suffix or Single Sign On if you are planning to use these features.

1. Click **Save Settings**.

## Configuring {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} for Facebook authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-configmca}

After you  configure the Facebook Application ID and your Facebook Application to serve iOS clients, you can enable Facebook authentication in {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}.

1. Open your app in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} dashboard.

1. Click **Mobile Options** and take note of **Route** (*applicationRoute*) and **App GUID** (*applicationGUID*). You need these values when you initialize the SDK.

1. Click the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} tile. The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard loads.

1. Click the **Configure** button on the **Facebook** panel.

1. Specify the Facebook Application ID and click **Save**.

## Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK for iOS
{: #facebook-auth-ios-sdk}

### Installing CocoaPods
{: #install-cocoapods}

1. Open Terminal and run the **pod --version** command. If CocoaPods is installed, the version number displays. You can skip to the next section to install the SDK.

1. If you do not have CocoaPods installed, run:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

For more information, see the [CocoaPods website](https://cocoapods.org/).

### Installing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client Swift SDK with CocoaPods
{: #facebook-auth-install-swift-cocoapods}

1. If you have no `Podfile` in your iOS project, run `pod init` to create the file.

1. Edit the `Podfile` and add the following lines:

 ```
use_frameworks!
pod 'BMSFacebookAuthentication'
	```
   **Note:** If you have this line in your Pod file: `pod 'BMSSecurity'`, you must remove it. The `BMSFacebookAuthentication` pod installs all necessary frameworks.

   **Tip:** You can add `use_frameworks!` to your Xcode target instead of having it in the Podfile.

1. Save the `Podfile` and run the `pod install` command from the command line. CocoaPods installs the dependencies. The progress and which components were added are displayed.

 **Important**: You now must open your project by using the `xcworkspace` file that is generated by CocoaPods. Usually the name is `{your-project-name}.xcworkspace`.  

1. Run `open {your-project-name}.xcworkspace` from command line to open your iOS project workspace.

### Configuring your iOS project for Facebook Authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-configproject}

1. Find the `info.plist` file, usually located under `Supporting files` folder in your Xcode project.

1. Configure Facebook integration by adding the following properties to your `info.plist` file:

   ![image](images/ios-facebook-infoplist-settings.png)


   Update the URL scheme and FacebookAppID properties with your Facebook Application ID.

   You can also update the `info.plist` file by right-clicking the file, selecting **Open as > Source Code** and adding the following XML:

   ```XML
	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>fb{your-facebook-application-id}</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>
	<key>FacebookAppID</key>
	<string>{your-facebook-application-id}</string>
	<key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
	<string>{your-faceebook-application-name}</string>
	<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
	<array>
		<string>fbauth</string>
		<string>fbauth2</string>
	</array>
	<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
	<dict>
	    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
	    <dict>
	        <key>facebook.com</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>                
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	        <key>fbcdn.net</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	        <key>akamaihd.net</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	    </dict>
	</dict>
```

   Update the `CFBundleURLSchemes` and `FacebookappID` properties with your Facebook Application ID. Update the `FacebookDisplayName` with the name of your Facebook application.

   **Important**: Make sure you are not overriding any existing properties in  the `info.plist` file. If you have overlapping properties, you must merge manually. For more information, see [Configure Xcode Project](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/) and [Preparing Your Apps for iOS9](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/ios9).

## Initializing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client Swift SDK
{: #facebook-auth-ios-initalize-swift}

Initialize the client SDK by passing the `applicationGUID` and `applicationRoute` parameters.

A common, though not mandatory, place to put the initialization code is in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your application delegate.

1. Get your application parameter values. Open your app in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard. Click **Mobile Options**. The `applicationRoute` and `applicationGUID` values are displayed in the **Route** and **App GUID** fields.

1. Import required framework in the class that you want to use {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK by adding the following headers:

 ```swift
 import UIKit
 import BMSCore
 import BMSSecurity
 ```
2. Initialize the client SDK.

 ```Swift
 let backendURL = "<applicationRoute>"
 let backendGUID = "<applicationGUID>"
 let tenantId = "<MCAServiceTenantId>"

 func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

 BMSClient.sharedInstance.initializeWithBluemixAppRoute(backendURL, bluemixAppGUID: backendGUID, bluemixRegion: BMSClient.<applicationBluemixRegion>)
 
 let mcaAuthManager = MCAAuthorizationManager.sharedInstance
 mcaAuthManager.initialize(tenantId: tenantId)

 BMSClient.sharedInstance.authorizationManager = MCAAuthorizationManager.sharedInstance

 FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.register()
 ```
 In the code:
 * Replace the `<applicationRoute>` and `<applicationGUID>` with values for **Route** and **App GUID** that you obtained from **Mobile Options** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.
 * Replace `<applicationBluemixRegion>` with the region where your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application is hosted. To view your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region, click the **Avatar** icon ![Avatar icon](images/face.jpg "Avatar icon")  in the menu bar to open the **Account and Support** widget.
 * Replace `tenantId` with the **tenantId** value. You find this value when you click the **Show Credentials** button on the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service tile.

1. Notify the Facebook SDK about the app activation and register the Facebook Authentication Handler by adding the following code to the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in your app delegate. Add this code after you initialize the BMSClient instance and register Facebook as the authentication manager.

 ```Swift
  return FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.onFinishLaunching(application, withOptions: launchOptions)
 ```

1. Copy the `FacebookAuthenticationManager.swift` file from the `BMSFacebookAuthentication` pod source files to your project directory.

1. Add the following code to your app delegate.

 ```Swift
	func application(application: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL,
					sourceApplication: String?, annotation: AnyObject) -> Bool {

		return FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.onOpenURL(application, url: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation)

	}
 ```

## Testing the authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-testing}

After the client SDK is initialized and Facebook Authentication Manager is registered, you can start making requests to your mobile back-end application.

### Before you begin
{: #facebook-auth-ios-testing-before}

You must be using the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}} boilerplate and already have a resource protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} at the `/protected` endpoint. If you need to set up a `/protected` endpoint, see [Protecting resources](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/protecting-resources.html).

1. Try to send a request to protected endpoint of your newly created mobile back-end application in your browser. Open the following URL: `{applicationRoute}/protected`.
For example: `http://my-mobile-backend.mybluemix.net/protected`
<br/>The `/protected` endpoint of a mobile back-end application that was created with MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate is protected with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}. An `Unauthorized` message is returned in your browser. This message is returned because this endpoint can be accessed only by mobile applications that are instrumented with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK.

1. Use your iOS application to make a request to the same endpoint.

	```Swift
  let protectedResourceURL = "<Your protected resource URL>" // any protected resource
  let request = Request(url: protectedResourceURL , method: HttpMethod.GET)
  let callBack:BmsCompletionHandler = {(response: Response?, error: NSError?) in

  if error == nil {
     print ("response:\(response?.responseText), no error")
  } else {
     print ("error: \(error)")
  }
  }

  request.sendWithCompletionHandler(callBack)
 ```

1. Run your application. A Facebook login screen pops up.
 
   ![image](images/ios-facebook-login.png)

   This screen might look slightly different if you are not currently logged in to Facebook.

1. Click **OK** to authorize {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}  to use your Facebook user identity for authentication purposes.

1. 	When your request succeeds, the following output is displayed in the Xcode console:

 ```
 "onAuthenticationSuccess info = Optional({
     attributes =     {
     };
     deviceId = 218227041863639;
     displayName = "Don+Lon";
     isUserAuthenticated = 1;
     userId = 218227041863639;
 })
 response:Optional("Hello, this is a protected resouce of the mobile backend application!"), no error
 ```
 {: screen}

1. You can also add logout functionality by adding the following code:

 ```
FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.logout(callBack)
```


 If you call this code after a user is logged in with Facebook, and the user tries to log in again, they are prompted to authorize {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} to use Facebook for authentication purposes.

 To switch users, you must call this code and the user must log out from Facebook in their browser.

 Passing `callBack` to the logout function is optional. You can also pass `nil`.
