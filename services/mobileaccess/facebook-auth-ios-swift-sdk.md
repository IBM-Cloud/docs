# Enabling Facebook authentication in iOS apps (Swift SDK)
{: #facebook-auth-ios}

To use Facebook as an identity provider in your iOS applications, add and configure the iOS Platform for your Facebook application.

## Before you begin
{: #facebook-auth-ios-before}

* You must have a resource that is protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} and an iOS project that is instrumented with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK.  For more information, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/getting-started.html) and [Setting up the iOS Swift SDK](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/getting-started-ios-swift-sdk.html).  
* Manually protect your backend application with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} server SDK. For more information, see [Protecting resources](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/protecting-resources.html).
* Create a Facebook Application ID. For more information, see [Obtaining a Facebook application ID from the Facebook Developer Portal](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/facebook-auth-overview.html#facebook-appID).

## Configuring your Facebook Application for the iOS Platform
{: #facebook-auth-ios-config}

1. Log in to [your Facebook app's dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).

1. Take note of the **App ID** for your app. You need this value when you configure your iOS project for Facebook authentication.

1. Click **Settings > Add Platform > iOS**.

1. Specify the *bundleId* of your iOS application. To find the *bundleId* of your iOS application, look for the **Bundle Identifier** in either the `info.plist` file or Xcode project **General** tab.
**Tip**: Consider enabling URL Scheme Suffix or Single Sign On if you are planning to use these features.

1. Click **Save Settings**.

## Configuring {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} for Facebook authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-configmca}

After you have configured the Facebook Application ID and your Facebook Application to serve iOS clients, you can enable Facebook authentication in {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}.

1. Open your app in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} dashboard.

1. Click **Mobile Options** and take note of **Route** (*applicationRoute*) and **App GUID** (*applicationGUID*). You need these values when you initialize the SDK.

1. Click the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} tile. The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard loads.

1. Click the **Facebook** tile.

1. Specify the Facebook Application ID and click **Save**.

## Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK for iOS
{: #facebook-auth-ios-sdk}

### Installing CocoaPods
{: #facebook-auth-cocoapods}

The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK is distributed with CocoaPods, a dependency manager for iOS projects. CocoaPods automatically downloads artifacts from repositories and makes them available to your iOS application.

1. Open Terminal and run `pod --version` command. If you already have CocoaPods installed, the version number is displayed. You can skip to the next section of this tutorial.

1. Install CocoaPods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods`. Refer to [CocoaPods website](https://cocoapods.org/) in case additional guidance is required.

1. Close XCode.

1. Open Terminal and `cd` into your project directory.

1.  Run `pod init`.

### Installing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client Swift SDK with CocoaPods
{: #facebook-auth-install-swift-cocoapods}

1. In your iOS project, edit the `Podfile` and add the following lines:

 ```
use_frameworks!
pod 'BMSFacebookAuthentication'
	```
 **Tip:** You can add `use_frameworks!` to your Xcode target instead of having it in the Podfile.

1. Save the `Podfile` and run the `pod install` command from the command line. CocoaPods installs the dependencies. The progress and which components were added are displayed.

 **Important**: You now must open your project by using the `xcworkspace` file that is generated by CocoaPods. Usually the name is `{your-project-name}.xcworkspace`.  

1. Run `open {your-project-name}.xcworkspace` from command line to open your iOS project workspace.

### Configuring your iOS project for Facebook Authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-configproject}

1. Find the `info.plist` file, usually located under `Supporting files` folder in your Xcode project.

1. Configure Facebook integration by adding the following properties to your `info.plist` file:

   ![image](images/ios-facebook-infoplist-settings.png)

   Update URL scheme and FacebookappID properties with your Facebook Application ID

   You can also update the `info.plist` file by right-clicking the file, selecting **Open as > Source Code** and adding the following XML:

   ```XML
	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>fb{your-facebook-application-id}</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>
	<key>FacebookAppID</key>
	<string>{your-facebook-application-id}</string>
	<key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
	<string>{your-faceebook-application-name}</string>
	<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
	<array>
		<string>fbauth</string>
		<string>fbauth2</string>
	</array>
	<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
	<dict>
	    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
	    <dict>
	        <key>facebook.com</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>                
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	        <key>fbcdn.net</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	        <key>akamaihd.net</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	    </dict>
	</dict>
```
   Update the URL scheme and FacebookappID properties with your Facebook Application ID. Update the FacebookDisplayName with the name of your Facebook application.

    **Important**: Make sure you are not overriding any existing properties in  the `info.plist` file. If you have overlapping properties, you must merge manually. For more information, see [Configure Xcode Project](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/) and [Preparing Your Apps for iOS9](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/ios9).

## Initializing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client Swift SDK
{: #facebook-auth-ios-initalize-swift}

Initialize the client SDK by passing the `applicationGUID` and `applicationRoute` parameters.

A common, though not mandatory, place to put the initialization code is in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your application delegate

1. Get your application parameter values. Open your app in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard. Click **Mobile Options**. The `applicationRoute` and `applicationGUID` values are displayed in the **Route** and **App GUID** fields.

1. Import required framework in the class that you want to use {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK by adding the following headers:

 ```swift
 import UIKit
 import BMSCore
 import BMSSecurity
 ```
2. Initialize the client SDK.	Replace the `<applicationRoute>` and `<applicationGUID>` with values for **Route** and **App GUID** that you obtained from **Mobile Options** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.

 ```Swift
 let backendURL = "<applicationRoute>"
 let backendGUID = "<applicationGUID>"

 func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

 BMSClient.sharedInstance.initializeWithBluemixAppRoute(backendURL, bluemixAppGUID: backendGUID, bluemixRegion: BMSClient.<application Bluemix region>)

 BMSClient.sharedInstance.authorizationManager = MCAAuthorizationManager.sharedInstance

 FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.register()
 ```

1. Notify the Facebook SDK about the app activation and register the Facebook Authentication Handler by adding the following code to the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in your app delegate. Add this code right after you initialize the BMSClient instance and register Facebook as the authentication manager.

 ```Swift
  return FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.onFinishLaunching(application, withOptions: launchOptions)
 ```

1. Copy the `FacebookAuthenticationManager.swift` file from the `BMSFacebookAuthentication` pod source files to your project directory.

1. Add the following code to your app delegate.

 ```Swift
	func application(application: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL,
					sourceApplication: String?, annotation: AnyObject) -> Bool {

		return FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.onOpenURL(application, url: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation)

	}
 ```

## Testing the authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-testing}

After the client SDK is initialized and Facebook Authentication Manager is registered, you can start making requests to your mobile backend.

### Before you begin
{: #facebook-auth-ios-testing-before}

You must be using the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}} boilerplate and already have a resource protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} at the `/protected` endpoint. If you need to set up a `/protected` endpoint, see [Protecting resources](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/protecting-resources.html).

1. Try to send a request to protected endpoint of your newly created mobile backend in your browser. Open the following URL: `{applicationRoute}/protected`.
For example: `http://my-mobile-backend.mybluemix.net/protected`
<br/>The `/protected` endpoint of a mobile backend that was created with MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate is protected with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}. An `Unauthorized` message is returned in your browser. This message is returned because this endpoint can be accessed only by mobile applications that are instrumented with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK.

1. Use your iOS application to make a request to the same endpoint.

	```Swift
  let protectedResourceURL = "<Your protected resource URL>" // any protected resource
  let request = Request(url: protectedResourceURL , method: HttpMethod.GET)
  let callBack:BmsCompletionHandler = {(response: Response?, error: NSError?) in

  if error == nil {
     print ("response:\(response?.responseText), no error")
  } else {
     print ("error: \(error)")
  }
  }

  request.sendWithCompletionHandler(callBack)
 ```

1. Run your application. A Facebook login screen pops up.

   ![image](images/ios-facebook-login.png)

   This screen might look slightly different if you are not currently logged in to Facebook.

1. Click **OK** to authorize {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}  to use your Facebook user identity for authentication purposes.

1. 	When your request succeeds, the following output is displayed in the Xcode console:

 ```
 "onAuthenticationSuccess info = Optional({
     attributes =     {
     };
     deviceId = 218227041863639;
     displayName = "Don+Lon";
     isUserAuthenticated = 1;
     userId = 218227041863639;
 })
 response:Optional("Hello, this is a protected resouce of the mobile backend application!"), no error
 ```

1. You can also add logout functionality by adding the following code:

 ```
FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.logout(callBack)
```

 If you call this code after a user is logged in with Facebook and the user tries to log in again, they are prompted to authorize {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} to use Facebook for authentication purposes.

 To switch users, you must call this code and the user must logout from Facebook in their browser.

 Passing `callBack` to the logout function is optional. You can also pass `nil`.
