*Last updated: 03 May 2016*

You can stop using the {{site.data.keyword.cdn_short}} service for an application by deleting the service from the dashboard.
{:shortdesc}

To stop the service, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the **Domains** tab. You will see the list of your applications that use the CDN service.  
2. Select the trash icon to disable CDN service for the application. You will see a confirmation message.  
3. Select **OK**. The CDN service is stopped.
4. Replace the CNAME target for your domain in your DNS provider record with the original CNAME target.
