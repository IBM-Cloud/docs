{:shortdesc}

## What versions of Terraform are supported?
{: #terraform-versions}

Version 0.9.3 is currently supported. 

## Can you import existing cloud resources into the service?
{: #existing-resources}

 At this time, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} does not support importing a user's `.tfstate` file. There are OSS tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming">terraforming <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>, that could be extended to support {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Cloud.
