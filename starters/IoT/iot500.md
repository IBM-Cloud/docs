{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} allows you to perform powerful device management operations, and store and access device data, connect a wide variety of devices and gateway devices. {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} provides secure communication to and from your devices by using MQTT and TLS.

## About Node-RED
{: #about_nodered}
Node-RED is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways.  You can use Node-RED to create a simulated thermostat that sends simulated data to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service. You can create cards to display real-time data in the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard. For more information, see the [Node-RED documentation](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/Node-RED/nodered.html#nodered).

## Deploying the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter
{: #deployStarter}

The Starter deploys the following services:  
- {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.
- {{site.data.keyword.sdk4node}} in which Node-RED runs.
- {{site.data.keyword.cloudant}} database in which Node-RED stores metadata.


1. Create the boilerplate, as follows:
  1. Log in to or register for Bluemix at https://www.bluemix.net
  2.	Select the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter boilerplate.
       - Open the catalog (Blue + or catalog tab)
       - Select the Boilerplate category.
       - Select the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter boilerplate.
  3. On the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter page, verify the space where you want to deploy Node-RED, verify the selections for **Create an app**, and click **Create** to add Node-RED to your Bluemix organization.

  For example,
    -	Space: dev
    - Name: myIoTApp
    - Host: myIoTApp

2.	Leave the rest of the options at their default values. After the application is deployed, the Get Started with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} page is displayed.  Note: The staging process might take a few minutes.

## Getting Around
{: #gettingaround}
As you perform the following steps, you will use three different tabs in your browser:
  1. Bluemix dashboards - to see the state of your deployment, read documentation and to launch the dashboards.
  2. {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard - Use the dashboard to work with this service. You'll use the dashboard to define device types, register devices, monitor incoming sensor data, create data visualization cards, and see live data visualizations.
  3. Node-RED - Running as a node.js web application, you'll configure and run the device simulator flow, and work with other flows to process data from {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

## Defining a simulated device in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}

  9.	Skip: Define Template.
  10.	Skip Metadata.
  11.	Click Create to add the new device type.
  12.	Click Next to add your device (Choose Device Type is preselected).
  13.	Enter a device ID such as LivingRoomThermo1.
  14.	Skip: Enter device metadata.
  15.	Click Next to add a device connection with an auto-generated authentication token.
  16.	Verify that the summary information is correct, and then click Add to add the connection.
  17.	In the device information page that opens, copy and save the device information:
      -	Organization ID
      -	Device Type
      -	Device ID
      - Authentication Method
      - Authentication Token

**Tip**: You will need Organization ID, Device Type, and Device ID in the next few steps to finalize the configuration of the Node-RED application to complete the connection.

## Configuring and running the Node-RED device simulator.
{: #confignodered}
Configure the Node-RED device simulator. Use the device simulator to send MQTT device messages to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. The device simulator sends temperature and humidity information to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

1. In your Bluemix dashboard, open Node-RED by selecting **View App** or clicking the link (for example, http:// myIoTApp.mybluemix.net).
2.	Click **Go to your Node-RED flow editor** to open the editor.
3.	Double-click the blue **Send** to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} node in the Device Simulator flow.
  1.	Verify that Authentication = Bluemix Service
  2.	Paste the Device Type from the device you registered.
  3.	Paste the Device ID from the device you registered.
  4.	Click OK.
4.	In the upper right corner of the Node-RED flow editor, click **Deploy**.
5.	Configure the Node-RED Temperature Monitor flow
  1.	Double-click the blue IBM IoT App In node in the Device Simulator flow.
  2.	Change Authentication to Bluemix Service
  3.	Select All for Device Type, Device Id, Event, and Format
  4.	Click OK.
6.	In the upper right corner of the Node-RED flow editor, click **Deploy**.
7.	Validate the device connection
  1.	In your other browser tab or window, return to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard.
  2.	Select Devices and click LivingRoomThermo1 or the name of the device that you added, if different.  
  The device information page opens. This view lets you see the connection status for your device. The device status is disconnected.
  3.	Back in your Node-RED flow editor, click the button on the gray Send Data node to generate an asset payload.
  The payload contains the following data points:
  ```
  {"d":{"temp":15,"humidity":50,"location":{"longitude":-98.49,"latitude":29.42}}}
  ```
  4.	In the debug tab of the right pane, verify that messages are created.
  5.	In the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} device information page, verify that you see the same data points received from the device in the Sensor Information section.

8.	Connect your sample IoT device to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} to view device data.
