3. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, if you have not already.
4. Provide the app name, modify the host name if required, and click **Create**.
5. Your app begins staging, and the landing page for your app on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dashboard displays as your app starts.
6. You can follow the instructions on that page to do the following tasks:
  * Download the Cloud Foundry command line interface.
  * Download the starter application.
  * Take steps to redeploy the starter application.
7. Modify the app and deploy again.

The directory containing the starter application you downloaded contains a README file.  Refer to the README for a description of the files in the starter application package.  Make changes to the code, deploy the application again, then see the effect in your running app.
