# Monitoring and logging
{: #monitoringandlogging}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} offers logging and monitoring capabilities across different services, such as Cloud Foundry and {{site.data.keyword.containershort}}. You can develop, run, and manage applications in any runtime without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure that is typically associated with developing and launching an app.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, by default, collects and displays performance metrics for CPU usage, memory utilization, and network I/O. These metrics provide information about the performance of individual cloud resources. You can monitor the performance of these resources in your cloud environment through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} UI. You can view near real-time data and historical data. For more information, see [Monitoring](monitoring/monitoring_bmx_ov.html#monitoring_bmx_ov).

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} logging capabilities are integrated in the platform and collection of data is automatically enabled for cloud resources. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, by default, collects and displays logs for your apps, apps runtimes, and compute runtimes where those apps run. For more information, see [Logging](logging/logging_bmx_ov.html#logging_bmx_ov).

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also offers infrastructure monitoring, that is available for every server, and easily readable reports. For more information, see [Infrastructure Monitoring & Reporting ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/infrastructure-monitoring){: new_window}.
